      <h1>About Surface Clean</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Dave—husband, mountain biker, Navy veteran, and follower of Christ. I’m also the founder of Surface Clean, 
        where I specialize in refurbishing and selling Tennant cleaning machines and other industrial floor cleaning equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started out as an aircraft mechanic in the U.S. Navy, working on hydraulic systems from 1985 to 1989. In 1996, 
        I joined Tennant Company as a road service rep, repairing Tennant floor scrubbers and sweepers in some of the most 
        secure buildings in Washington, D.C.—including the White House, Capitol Building, CIA training center, FBI headquarters, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2002, I launched Surface Clean to help businesses and facilities get reliable, cost-effective equipment without 
        the inflated price tags. Every machine I sell is one I’ve personally inspected, repaired, and tested. I take pride 
        in doing honest work, offering solid equipment, and treating customers the way I’d want to be treated.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, my wife and I enjoy the quiet (mostly!) with our grown kids off living their lives, and I spend my free 
        time mountain biking and living out my faith in everything I do—on and off the job.
